# make groups

Including the "prod" main file and the challenge 14-liner ;)

## install (? idk tbh)
To download the file use git:
```
git clone https://github.com/TylenolWasTaken/group_maker
```

## Usage
execute it with python (windows):
```
python3 main.py 3 --am --absent jayden aiden
```
or as a script (linux & mac(?) ):
```
./main.py 3 --am --absent jayden aiden
```
where `3` is the size of each group, `--am` is the class period, and `--absent` is an optional value of students separated with spaces. <br/>
For more detailed help you can run `python3 main.py --help`.
